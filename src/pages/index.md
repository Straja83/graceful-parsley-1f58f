      At Layer123, we connect everyone involved in the network transformation
      process – helping operators and network owners to virtualise their
      networks and find commercial benefits from the improved performance this
      transformation brings.


      With presentations that are always unique to the events you hear them at,
      our congresses in The Hague, Madrid and Dubai bring together
      representatives from telecoms operators, network owners, analysts, data
      centres, solution providers, and more – everyone with a voice in how
      networking is moving to an open future.


      Sessions at our events don’t just cover technical details like SDN, NFV,
      OpenRAN, edge computing, applied AI, disaggregation, automation and
      orchestration. They also reveal how operators and network owners are
      commercialising these technologies – making a real difference to operator
      profitability.
